            <p>We are also proud to be the only Davines exclusive hair salon in Leicester situated on 14 South Frederick Street in the heart of Leicester's city centre, we provide hairdressing services for both men and women. The bright spacious feel offers a retreat of calm amongst the chaos and rush of everyday city life.</p>
    
            <p>
                The interior was built with sustainable values and we were committed to reducing the environmental impact with the décor choices. The salon’s unique design features all reclaimed wood with complimenting natural colours and materials. We wanted the salon to work in harmony with the Davines product range.
