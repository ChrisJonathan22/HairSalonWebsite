The bright spacious feel offers a retreat of calm amongst the chaos and rush of everyday city life.</p> 

                <p>It is the perfect place to come to experience what Davines is all about. Davines gives careful attention to and respects our environment. By using high grade natural ingredients, their products are original, authentic and connect emotionally with people.</p>
    
                <p>The interior was built with sustainable values and we were committed to reducing the environmental impact with the décor choices. The salon’s unique design features all reclaimed wood with complimenting natural colours and materials. We wanted the salon to work in harmony with the Davines product range. </p>
